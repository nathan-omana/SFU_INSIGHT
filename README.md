# SFU_INSIGHT
A university course insight platform developed during XHacks 2026 by Armin Ahmadi, Jishith Guntamudougou, Nathan Omana, and Gabriel Robles.

## What is SFUInsight?
SFUInsight is a website that provides detailed visualized analytics and crowd-sourced study resources for Simon Fraser University courses, bridging the gap between official course outlines and student reality.

## Features
- Course Search: Search for courses by code, name, description, or instructor.
- Course Details: View detailed information about each course, including course description, prerequisites, and credit hours.
- Course Analytics: View visualized analytics for each course, including course difficulty, workload, and student satisfaction.
- Course Reviews: Read and write reviews for each course.

## How is it different from other course websites?
- Crowd-sourced data: Unlike official university websites that only provide course outlines, SFUInsight provides real student feedback and insights.
- Visualized analytics: We use data visualization to present complex information in an easy-to-understand format.
- Focus on student success: Our goal is to help students make informed decisions about their education and succeed in their courses.

**Our motivation:**
From previous experience, planning ahead for our future courses has always proven to be a challenge. We found it difficult to find reliable information about courses and their difficulty levels, and we wanted to create a platform that would make it easier for students to plan their courses and succeed in their studies. Aggregating real student notes, helpful study resources, and validated course syllabi provides a much more supportive platform for students to plan their courses and succeed in their studies.
